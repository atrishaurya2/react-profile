                <p id='myBioPara'>I am an aspiring web developer and I love to work on new and intresting projects. I believe in simplistic yet creative 
                    approach to any challenge. I have a bit of experience in languages like C,Python and JavaSciprt<br/>
                    I have had the opportunity to work for 'Techtainment' during ATMOS which was a great learning experience. Being part 
                    of other technical clubs like AeroClub and attending various other workshops has also helped me to deveolp my skills. </p>
